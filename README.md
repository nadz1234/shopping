Welcome to Nads list app , 

This app is great to organise your list of items that you need from a store . Easily fetches data available that you can add to your own custom list 

Features

1. Nads list will fetch data of products that are available, categorized to your choice or simply search for an item!
2. You can then add an item to your list if you wish to buy 
3. You will also have the flexiblity to edit quantity , remove and also mark off as you buy them 
4. You can also email your desired list to a friend.

 I have used interesting technologies such as expo, Mobx, axios, react query and async storage to easily fetch and cache your data , and allows room for scalability.
